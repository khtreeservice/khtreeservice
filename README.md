- 👋 Hi, I’m @khtreeservice
- 👀 I’m interested in promoting my tree services for removal.
- I have been felling trees privately for homeowners since 2017 to clear trails, fell hazardous hanging trees, and collect dead standing trees for firewood.
- I have a Forestry Technician Diploma from Sir Sandford Fleming College where I learned how to safely operate a chainsaw, fell trees in a safe and controlled manor,
- properly identify defects in trees, and how to prune to promote tree health.
- I have a post-graduate certificate in GIS (Geographic Information Systems) where I studied data science, data collection, mapping software, spatial statistics, and cartography.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to climb trees safely with the proper PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) to be able to remove trees from the top down.
- I am also learning how to prune within the canopy of trees in a way that does not harm them.
- 💞️ I’m looking to create a repository for people who are interest in hiring my me for my services to be able to see the kind of work I have been completing.
- 📫 If you have arrived at this ReadMe then you should already have my contact information.
